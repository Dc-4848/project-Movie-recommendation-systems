# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System - Content-Based Filtering

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that recommends movies based on metadata such as genres, cast, director, tagline, and keywords. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to find similar movies based on user input.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Content-based recommender systems suggest similar items to a user based on a particular item. In this case, the system takes a movie title as input and recommends similar movies using the textual content of that movie’s metadata.

- 📏 Calculates **Cosine Similarity** between movies
- 🔁 Recommends top 30 similar movies to the one entered by the user
- 🧰 Handles missing values and combines multiple features for better accuracy
