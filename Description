    üé¨ Movie Recommendation System - Content-Based Filtering
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    This is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies 
    similar to the one you like. It uses movie metadata such as genres, cast, 
    director, tagline, and keywords to find similar titles.

    ‚úÖ Technologies Used:
    - Python, Pandas, NumPy
    - Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
    - difflib (for fuzzy matching movie titles)

    üß† How it Works:
    - The system combines selected metadata into a single string.
    - It uses TF-IDF to convert text into vectors.
    - Cosine similarity is used to find how similar the movies are.
    - Based on a user-input movie, the system recommends the top 30 most similar movies.

    üìÅ Dataset:
    - TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset (4803 movies, 24 columns)
    - Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
